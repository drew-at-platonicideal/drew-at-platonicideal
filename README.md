ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @drew-at-platonicideal

Most of the repositories here are kept private, as platonicideal (which is mostly myself at the moment, codewise) contain potentially business or client sensitive information.

I can be reached at drew@platonicideal.com

To the DigitalOcean Droplet limit increasing team- thanks for your time!
